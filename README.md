## DESCRIPTION OF TASK

The **Weather Application** project is designed to showcase the integration of Java with real-world APIs to fetch and display live weather data. Weather forecasting and updates are essential in day-to-day life, and this project demonstrates how external APIs can be consumed to build interactive and practical applications.

The project retrieves current weather information for a given city using the **OpenWeatherMap API**. It leverages **Java Networking (HttpURLConnection)** to establish a connection with the weather service and uses the **org.json library** for parsing JSON responses.

Key functionalities of the application include:

1. **API Integration** – Connects to the OpenWeatherMap API using a unique API key and fetches live weather details in JSON format.

2. **City-based Weather Retrieval** – Users can specify any city (e.g., London, Paris, New York), and the program fetches corresponding temperature, weather conditions, and other details.

3. **JSON Parsing** – Implements `org.json` library to extract specific details (like temperature and description) from the JSON response returned by the API.

4. **Error Handling** – Includes handling for invalid API keys, incorrect city names, or connectivity issues, ensuring smooth execution.

5. **User-Friendly Output** – Displays the weather details in a clear and readable format on the console.

This project helps interns understand:

* How to work with **APIs in Java**.
* How to send **HTTP requests and process responses**.
* The use of **JSON parsing** for extracting relevant information.
* The importance of error handling in network-based applications.

By completing this project, interns gain exposure to practical Java development involving **real-time data integration**. Such applications form the basis for more advanced systems like weather dashboards, mobile apps, or IoT-based weather monitoring systems.

Overall, the **Weather Application** not only enhances Java programming skills but also provides insight into building applications that connect with external services and deliver meaningful data to users.
